                    <p><strong>York University—Canada's third-largest university with 55,000+ students—issued an RFP for a complete campus food services overhaul.</strong> Chartwells Canada needed a compelling brand identity to anchor their pitch and differentiate from competitors.</p>
                    <p>The core tension: <strong>How do you create a brand that feels relevant to 18-24 year olds without relying on aesthetic trends that will feel stale in 12 months?</strong></p>
                    <p>Rather than chasing Gen Z trends, I anchored the brand in York's existing equity—the bold red, the strong geometric "Y" and "U" letterforms—while bringing fresh energy to campus dining. The result: a brand that feels unmistakably "York" while resonating with a diverse student body from 178 countries.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-header">Design for Longevity, Not Trends</h2>
                    <p><strong>Three design principles guided every decision:</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>1. Fun, not silly</strong><br>Playful typography and bold colors that feel energetic without being cartoonish.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Youthful, not young</strong><br>A visual language that respects students as adults, not teenagers.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Timeless energy</strong><br>Strong graphic foundations that can evolve without complete redesign.</p>
                    <p>The repeating "YU" pattern creates visual texture that scales from app icons to building murals, reinforces brand recognition through repetition, and creates a sense of community: <strong>this is YOUR dining experience.</strong></p>

                    <h2 class="section-header">Creating a Multi-Brand Ecosystem</h2>
                    <p><strong>York's RFP specifically requested unique, differentiated food brands that would compete with off-campus options.</strong> Beyond the master YU Eats identity, I created 416 Burger Co.—a playful sub-brand referencing Toronto's area code for immediate local relevance.</p>
                    <p>The 416 identity takes a more irreverent tone with puns like "Keep on Grillin' Baby" and "Oh How Bun-derful" that speak to Gen Z's appreciation for self-aware humor. Bold color blocks and retro-inspired typography create a distinct personality while maintaining cohesion with the YU Eats system.</p>
                    <p><strong>This demonstrates my ability to create differentiated sub-brands within a cohesive master system</strong>—each with its own personality but unified by strategic design principles.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-header">Mobile Ordering Experience</h2>
                    <p><strong>The mobile app design prioritizes speed and ease of use</strong>—critical for students ordering between classes. The interface maintains the bold red and clean typography while adding functional UI elements that reduce friction in the ordering process.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key features designed:</strong><br>
                    • Mobile ordering with real-time tracking<br>
                    • Customizable dietary preferences<br>
                    • Scheduled pickup between classes<br>
                    • Seamless payment integration<br>
                    • Location-based menu browsing</p>
                    <p>The signature YU pattern system creates cohesion between physical and digital touchpoints, ensuring brand recognition whether students are in the app or walking past a dining location.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-header">Environmental Design & Wayfinding</h2>
                    <p><strong>The brand pattern translates powerfully to large-scale environmental graphics.</strong> Wall murals at dining locations create Instagram-worthy moments while reinforcing brand presence across campus. The repeating pattern works at any scale—from napkins to building-sized installations.</p>
                    <p>I designed comprehensive wayfinding systems including mobile pickup signage, location identifiers, and promotional messaging that aligns with York's values. This includes sustainability initiatives like the "Proudly Fighting Food Waste" campaign.</p>
                    <p><strong>The environmental system demonstrates:</strong><br>
                    • Scalability from small touchpoints to architectural installations<br>
                    • Wayfinding that enhances user experience<br>
                    • Alignment with institutional values and student priorities<br>
                    • Social media-friendly spaces that encourage organic promotion</p>
