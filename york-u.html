                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p><strong>York University—Canada's third-largest university with 55,000+ students—issued an RFP for a complete campus food services overhaul.</strong> Chartwells Canada needed a compelling brand identity to anchor their pitch and differentiate from competitors.</p>
                <p>The core tension: <strong>How do you create a brand that feels relevant to 18-24 year olds without relying on aesthetic trends that will feel stale in 12 months?</strong></p>
                <p>York's student body is one of the most diverse in Canada—over 10,000 international students from 178 countries. The brand needed to feel inclusive and representative, not designed for a narrow demographic.</p>

        <!-- Section: Strategic Approach -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <div class="section-text">
                <h2>Strategic Approach: Designed for Longevity</h2>
                <p><strong>Three design principles guided every decision:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>1. Fun, not silly</strong><br>Playful typography and bold colors that feel energetic without being cartoonish.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Youthful, not young</strong><br>A visual language that respects students as adults, not teenagers.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Timeless energy</strong><br>Strong graphic foundations that can evolve without complete redesign.</p>
                <p>Rather than chasing Gen Z trends, I anchored the brand in York's existing equity—the bold red (#E31837), the strong geometric "Y" and "U" letterforms—while bringing fresh energy to campus dining.</p>

                <h2>Brand Identity: YU Eats</h2>
                <p>The YU Eats wordmark leverages the natural connection between "York University" and the brand name—the Y and U letterforms become both a name and an address to the student: <strong>"You Eat."</strong></p>
                <p>The repeating "YU" pattern creates visual texture that scales from app icons to building murals, reinforces brand recognition through repetition, and creates a sense of community: <strong>this is YOUR dining experience.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>The brand pattern translates powerfully to large-scale environmental graphics.</strong> Wall murals at dining locations create Instagram-worthy moments while reinforcing brand presence across campus. The repeating pattern works at any scale—from napkins to building-sized installations.</p>

                <h2>Creating a Multi-Brand Ecosystem: 416 Burger Co.</h2>
                <p><strong>York's RFP specifically requested unique, differentiated food brands that would compete with off-campus options.</strong> Beyond the master YU Eats identity, I created 416 Burger Co.—a playful sub-brand referencing Toronto's area code for immediate local relevance.</p>
                <p>The 416 identity takes a more irreverent tone with puns like "Keep on Grillin' Baby" and "Oh How Bun-derful" that speak to Gen Z's appreciation for self-aware humor. Bold color blocks and retro-inspired typography create a distinct personality while maintaining cohesion with the YU Eats system.</p>
                <p><strong>This demonstrates my ability to create differentiated sub-brands within a cohesive master system</strong>—each with its own personality but unified by strategic design principles.</p>
