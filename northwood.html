                    <p>Creating a brand identity for corrections culinary services requires a careful balance. The brand needs to communicate professionalism and reliability to correctional facility administrators while avoiding institutional coldness that could impact the dignity of meal service.</p>
                    <p>The challenge was to develop a name and identity system that feels grounded, trustworthy, and human. The brand needed to work across institutional settings while suggesting care, quality, and a connection to positive values like growth and nourishment.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-header">Exploration</h2>
                    <p>Multiple naming and visual directions were explored. Concepts like Holdfast emphasized stability and dependability, while Surepath Eats suggested a forward-looking journey. Sojourn and Rootstone explored themes of grounding, temporary stays, and foundational support.</p>
                    <p>Each concept was evaluated for its ability to communicate appropriate values: reliability without rigidity, care without condescension, and professionalism without institutional sterility. The typography across all concepts emphasized clarity and strength through bold letterforms and clear hierarchy.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-header">The Solution</h2>
                    <p>Northwood emerged as the strongest direction. The name suggests natural strength and endurance, while the tree icon reinforces themes of growth, stability, and life. The evergreen tree represents resilience and continuity, appropriate symbolism for a service focused on consistent, dependable meal provision.</p>
                    <p>The bold sans-serif typography communicates professionalism and clarity, while the forest green color palette connects to nature and growth. The brand successfully positions the culinary service as a reliable partner focused on dignity, quality, and care in challenging environments.</p>
