                    <p>Liberty Entertainment Group has been redefining Toronto's restaurant and nightlife experience for over 30 years. Operating landmark venues like Casa Loma, BlueBlood Steakhouse, and Liberty Grand Entertainment Complex, they serve 1.75 million guests annually across 500,000+ square feet of hospitality space.</p>
                    <p>Their existing logo featured classic serif typography with an integrated torch element. While it had served them well, it felt dated against the contemporary hospitality landscape. The challenge was to modernize the visual identity without losing the heritage and recognition they had built across their Toronto venues.</p>

                <div class="content-text">
                    <h2 class="section-header">The Process</h2>
                    <p>The design exploration began with concepts that retained the torch icon while refining typography and proportions. Initial rounds explored both elegant thin letterforms and bold contemporary treatments. Stakeholder feedback requested further modernization to feel less traditional and more current.</p>
                    <p>Subsequent rounds explored bolder directions including literal hospitality iconography, geometric accents, and even custom hand-crafted letterforms with art deco-inspired inline strokes. Each iteration balanced the need for premium positioning with flexible application across both digital platforms and physical signage.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-header">The Solution</h2>
                    <p>The final approved direction retained the torch icon as a key brand equity element while modernizing the overall typography and proportions. The system includes a primary horizontal lockup with the torch integrated into the wordmark, a standalone circular icon for social media and favicons, and flexible lockups for diverse applications.</p>
                    <p>The logo successfully bridges heritage and modernity, maintaining recognition while feeling contemporary and premium. Currently live across Liberty Entertainment Group properties, the identity positions them as leaders in Toronto's hospitality industry while supporting their continued growth and evolution.</p>
