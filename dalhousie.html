                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p><strong>Dalhousie University needed a unified hospitality brand system spanning 5 dining halls and 8+ retail cafés across multiple campuses—while honoring the institution's 200-year heritage and connecting with today's students.</strong></p>
                <p>This was part of Compass Group Canada's <strong>$180 million RFP response</strong> to Dalhousie University. The timeline: <strong>4 weeks</strong> to develop a comprehensive brand strategy that could transform campus dining into a cohesive, branded experience.</p>
                <p>The existing dining program lacked cohesive visual identity. Each location operated with inconsistent branding, making wayfinding difficult and diluting the overall campus dining experience. The solution needed to be implementable at scale—from signage to digital menu boards to environmental graphics—while respecting Dalhousie's established visual identity.</p>
                <p><strong>This wasn't just logo design. It was creating an entire brand ecosystem</strong> that could flex across vastly different contexts: from traditional dining halls serving hundreds to intimate coffee shops, from quick-service retail to specialty concepts like boba tea.</p>
            </div>

        <!-- Section: Strategic Approach -->

            <div class="section-text">
                <h2>Strategic Approach: Three-Tier Brand Architecture</h2>
                <p><strong>I developed a hierarchical brand system with three distinct levels, each serving a specific strategic purpose:</strong></p>

                <div style="background: var(--bg-secondary); padding: 2em; border-radius: 8px; margin: 2em 0;">
                    <p><strong style="color: var(--accent-color);">Level 1: Master Brand</strong><br>
                    <strong>Dalhousie Hospitality</strong> — The umbrella identity anchoring the entire system, connecting every dining experience back to the university's values and heritage.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1.5em;"><strong style="color: var(--accent-color);">Level 2: Dining Halls</strong><br>
                    <strong>Risley, Howe, Shireff, O'Brien, Jenkins</strong> — Each with a unique identity reflecting its location, history, and student community. These are destinations, not just cafeterias.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1.5em;"><strong style="color: var(--accent-color);">Level 3: Retail Cafés</strong><br>
                    <strong>Ground Zero, Green Café, Topio's, Cox, Brief Break, Frederic's, and more</strong> — Quick-service and specialty concepts, each with distinct personalities while maintaining family resemblance.</p>
                </div>

                <p><strong>Design Principles:</strong> Geometric, symmetrical, high-contrast, authoritative—modernized heritage that speaks to students while respecting tradition. The tone is confident, modern, inclusive, and human. Friendly but aspirational.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Section: Research & Discovery -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <div class="section-text">
                <h2>Research & Brand DNA</h2>
                <p><strong>Before designing a single logo, I conducted deep research into Dalhousie's existing brand system.</strong> The goal: create a hospitality identity that feels like a natural extension of the university, not an external addition.</p>
                <p>I deconstructed Dalhousie's visual language—the typography, the color palette (black and gold), the iconic eagle crest. I identified a distinctive design element in the crest—an abstracted beak/wing form I termed the <strong>"Dalcon."</strong> This shape became a unifying motif throughout my brand system, creating subtle visual connections back to the university's heritage.</p>

                <h2>Exploration & Ideation</h2>
                <p><strong>I explored multiple concept territories—from laurel wreaths to shield systems to typographic solutions—testing which visual language could best scale across the entire hospitality ecosystem.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Why laurels?</strong> Laurels are deeply embedded in academic tradition—the word "laureate" comes from this symbolism. A wreath made of leaves/grain also ties naturally to harvest, abundance, and community. The central circle is flexible: it can symbolize the table, the plate, the sun, or unity.</p>
                <p>Beyond the master brand, I explored how iconography, color systems, and naming conventions could work together to differentiate locations while maintaining family resemblance. Coffee cups, wheat stalks, leaves, and geometric forms were tested as potential icon systems.</p>

                    <h2>Concept 01: The Circle System</h2>
                    <p><strong>The recommended direction uses the circle as the unifying design element—a laurel-framed "D" anchors the master brand while each dining hall receives a unique circular icon reflecting its personality.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>System Logic:</strong> The master brand uses a laurel-framed circle with the "D" monogram. Dining halls each get a distinctive circular icon within a yellow ring. Cafés extend the system through color-coded divided circles for easy wayfinding.</p>
                    <p><strong>Strategic Icon Selection:</strong> Each icon was chosen to reflect the hall's unique character:</p>
                    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 1em;">
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">• <strong>Risley:</strong> Coffee cup signals social energy</li>

                <p><strong>The brand system extends to physical environments—from interior signage to digital menu boards to retail kiosk design.</strong> Each touchpoint reinforces the cohesive identity while respecting the unique character of each space.</p>
                <p>I developed complete environmental mockups showing how the brand would appear in real dining hall settings. The system needed to work at every scale: from small wayfinding signs to building-scale exterior signage to digital menu animations.</p>

                <p>Each café concept received full branding: logo lockups, color palettes, typography systems, and environmental mockups. The designs needed to appeal to different student demographics while maintaining visual cohesion with the master brand.</p>

                    "The proposal demonstrates how a unified hospitality identity can transform campus dining—from wayfinding to student engagement to brand perception."
